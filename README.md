## Python Voice Assistant

A simple python voice assistant, inspired by [CodeWithHarry's](https://github.com/CodeWithHarry) 1st [Mega Project](https://github.com/CodeWithHarry/The-Ultimate-Python-Course/tree/main/Mega%20Project%201%20-%20Jarvis) from his Python Tutorial.

### Introduction

Since this project is NOT a direct copy-paste - rather it's made for learning purposes - so as you can see, it lacks in WeatherAPI and OpenAI Integration. It's solely based on what I have learned from Harry's tutorial.

#### Setup

1. Clone this repo in your workspace
2. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `main.py`


#### Features

1. It can tell the information about current time in 12-Hour Format. 
- Include `current time` in your instruction
- - e.g. `Hey, what's the current time?`

2. It can evaluate basic arithmetic operations 
- Instruction: `evaluate {expression}` 
- - e.g. `evaluate six multiplied by five hundered and ten` 
- - which will result in the input `evaluate 6 x 510` 

#### To Implement

Future goals for this project are to make progresses, such as:


- Adding a UI to make it more user friendly

- Integrating NLP to get rid of "phrase capture" method for determining response

- Allowing instructions for tasks like File reading, creation and manipulation

- Adding interacive games involving ML modules
